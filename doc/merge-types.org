* Introduction
People have different opinions on what are "overlay", "fzozen"
etc. merges and what was really implemented in lispmds, also their
opinions change depending on their current work. To avoid infinite
discussions and renaming, merge types are now just numbered.

See also [[https://github.com/acorg/acmacs.r/issues/5][github issue]]

* Merge type 1
Tables are merged. Projections in the source charts are ignored. The
merge has *no projections*.

* Merge type 2
Tables are merged. The best projection of the first chart is
copied. Projections of the second chart are ignored. Coordinates of
non-commong points of the second chart are set to NaN. The merge has
just one projection. If the first chart has no projections, error is
raised. Resulting projection is *not relaxed*.

relax_incremental() can be used to relax the merge.

* Merge type 3
Tables are merged. The best projection of the second chart orieneted
to the best projection of the first chart using procrustes.
Coordinates of the non-common points are copied to the resulting
layout from their source layouts. Coordinates of each common point are
set to the middle between coordinates of that point in the source
projections. Resulting projection is *not relaxed*.

* Merge type 4
Merge type 3 is performed. Then the points of the first chart
(including common points) are fixed and the merge is *relaxed*,
i.e. points found only in the second chart are allowed to move.

* Merge type 5
Tables are merged. The best projection of the second chart orieneted
to the best projection of the first chart using procrustes.
Coordinates of all points of the first chart and coordinates of
the non-common points of the second chart are copied to the resulting
layout from their source layouts. Then the points of the first chart
(including common points) are fixed and the merge is *relaxed*,
i.e. points found only in the second chart are allowed to move.
