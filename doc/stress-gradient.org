* Stress
Stress is the sum of contributions for each titer.
** Contribution for numeric titer
Square of differences between map distance (between antigen and serum) and table distance.
** Contribution for less-than titer
Difference is computed by subtracting the map distance from the table
distance and adding 1. Difference is then squared and multipled by
sigmoid of difference. The result of multiplication is contribution.
** Contribution for more-than titer
More-than titers are ignored.
** Table distance
Titer is divided by 10 and logged (base 2), then subtructed from column basis.
** Sigmoid
sigmoid(x) = 1/(1 + exp(-x * 10))
